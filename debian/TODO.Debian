TODO list for torcs in Debian
-----------------------------

Upstream tarballs handling:
- Migrate upstream Makefiles to be generated by Automake, thus avoid
  loops and unnecesary recursion, also having a sane Make system. 
  Status: on progress, talking with upstream about it
- Talk to upstream to merge with this new yet-on-progress Makefile system.
  Status: work on progress. Debian part is prepared to support it.
